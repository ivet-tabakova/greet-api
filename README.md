## Project Overview
This app allows the user to connect with favorite artists, creators and influencers by using an API to pull data and display the results.
Every object is presented as a card with details (image, name, description and category).
You can filter the results in several ways - by category, by name and by price. 
'Add To Cart' button sends the user to another page where he can fill in his details and receive a greeting from the celebrity he has chosen.

## Features
- Pulls data from API and renders the results
- Filter the results
- Link to another page, where you can receive a greeting from the celebrity

React projects typically have dependencies that you need to install. To do this, use a package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or yarn. Here's how to use npm:

npm install

Or if you prefer using yarn:

yarn install
This will install all the required libraries and packages specified in the package.json file.
